# Icon Match Game

Icon Match Game is an Android application designed to challenge your memory and quick-thinking skills. This project was developed to enhance Android development skills using modern tools like Jetpack Compose and ViewModel.

## **Features**
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Players match icons by tapping on them in a dynamic UI.
- **Shuffle Mechanism:** Icons are shuffled periodically, adding an extra challenge.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Immediate updates to the UI as players interact with the game.
- **State Preservation:** Game state is preserved using LiveData and ViewModel, ensuring a seamless experience across configuration changes.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Jetpack Compose:** For building a modern, declarative user interface.
- **ViewModel:** To manage UI-related data and logic.
- **LiveData:** To observe and manage the UI state reactively.

## **Future Updates**
- **Separation of Concerns:** Refactor the project to clearly separate business logic and ViewModel from the UI layer, improving maintainability and scalability.
- **Progressive Difficulty:** Implement a scaling mechanism where the game introduces new challenges, such as more icons or reduced time limits, as the player progresses.
- **Enhanced Visuals:** Add animations and sound effects to improve the overall player experience.
- **High Score System:** Introduce a leaderboard to track players' highest scores.
